    <h3>What is this page all about?</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This website is going to showcase <em>my experience</em> as I attend and complete the 14 week <strong>#VetsWhoCode bootcamp</strong>. The bootcamp is intended to take someone who has little to no knowledge of programming and teach them enough skills so that they are able to begin working as an entry level programmer.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my own experiences, thoughts, and commentary on the program, I will also be recording here much of the instruction given, tools, and guidance given during the bootcamp.
        <br/>This will be useful for my own future reference, as well as other veterans who may be going through the course or who are looking into it.
      </p>

    <h3>What is #VetsWhoCode?</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>#VetsWhoCode</strong> is a veteran ran non-profit with the mission of teaching veterans how to code in order to help them transition out of the military and into the civilian workforce. All training is free of cost to the veteran and is conducted fully online so that any veteran can participate regardless of geographical location.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>What do I hope to get out of #VetsWhoCode?</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Well, quite a lot:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A knowledge of programming</li>
        <li>Familiarity with the tech world</li>
        <li>A network of other veterans within the tech community</li>
        <li>The skills to pay the bills!</li>
      </ul>
